# TomDoc Specification

TomDoc is a code documentation specification that helps you write precise
documentation that is nice to read in plain text, yet structured enough to be
automatically extracted and processed by a machine.

This is the TomDoc specification text. Work on the specification itself will
be done here and then transferred to http://tomdoc.org when a new version has
been tagged.
